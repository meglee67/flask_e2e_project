# Web Service
* The idea for this webs service is a site/form where you are able to select from a drop-down menu, your insurance provider and a medicine, and upon submission, it displays information about the medicine and insurance; if the medicine is covered by the chosen insurance provider and how much the medicine will cost.
* Fufill data requirement option 2: Involve the use of fake data that you create and store in a database and use in your product and then displays data.

# Technologies Used
* I attempted to go for the 110 points so, I attempted to fufill all the web service requirements, using:
    * Github - For version control
    * .env - environment variables
    * Flask - backend
    * Tailwind - frontend styling
    * MySQL GCP Database 
    * SQLAlchemy - ORM
    * API
    * Google OAuth
    * Sentry.io
    * Docker
    * GCP Cloud Deployment
